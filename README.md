#HTML

Take a look at [w3schools.com](http://www.w3schools.com/) and get an idea for what HTML tags are all about.		
Then, pop over to the `template.html` file and start to experiment with the tags you learned about!		

When you're finished, right click the `template.html` file in your text editor and click "copy full path".		
Paste the path into your browser, and you should be able to see your HTML doc at work!
